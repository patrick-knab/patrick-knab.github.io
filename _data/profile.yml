    I am a third-year PhD candidate at Clausthal University of Technology working on Computer Vision and Interpretable AI. My research investigates how foundation models can be used to derive domain-specific visual concepts that make neural networks more transparent and easier to interpret. I am particularly interested in how such concept representations can improve the performance of vision foundation models in image and video generation, understanding, and downstream decision-making.
